# Structural characterization of uORFs using Deep Learning prediction methods
This project was developed in the third semester of my master degree bioinformatics. Overall our goal was to present to the scientific community for the first time a characterization of folding preferences of so called upstream open reading frames.

Therefore we developed our own deep learning approach trained by proteins from the PDB. We compared our results to the current front runner alphafold.
Additionally we did basic statistics on uORFs and tried to get more informations by using iupred2a to predict their intrinsic disorder.
